Steps to Run - 
1. Open the filename.ino file Arduino IDE.
2. Select the Board from settings as Arduino Mega 2560.
3. Connect the Arduino to the PC via USB cable.
4. Connect the Function Generators on A0 and A3 and connect them to ground on board.
5. Connect the CRO to pin 9 and connect it to ground on board.
6. Set the Function Generator with appropriate voltages, offset and frequencies to make sure the output voltage is between 0 to 5V.
7. Compile the Code and Upload it to the Arduino ( CTRL + R, CTRL + U).
8. You will observe the LED brightness according to the output, also if CRO is not available Serial Plotter could be used.
9. If reading the output on some other place use the baud rate as 9600.
10. The folder contains sum.ino and difference.ino giving the required output as mentioned in the question.
